# Todo

## Repo

- [ ] Find a way to run other Docker tasks on the same Raspberry Pi, alongside Home Assistant
- [ ] Log system metrics (memory, CPU load) to Firebase logging
  - [ ] analytics and automated warnings

## Hardware

- [ ] Changing the SD Card to 32 GB, A2 class
- [ ] Consider a fanned enclosure, if CPU loads seem high enough

Maybe:

- Re-visit the Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5 electric issue on Raspberry Pi 4's ([link](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/3027)). Did they get a fix that doesn't involve USB 2.0 hubs?
